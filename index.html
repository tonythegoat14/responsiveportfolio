            <p>
                My name is Antonnio Davis, graduate of The Langston Hughes high school class of 2019. I a former athlete for 12 years always had a love for technology in all matters. Growing up in a house full of technology not knowing how or what is really possible,
                I when able too would spend time with my computure wiz cousin at an young age and watch him work his "magic" to get an better understanding. As years go by living in Fairburn, Georgia with my mother and sibiling I attended RMS which had
                an computer coding class. Unfornatually I was only able to take the class for 2 months and never took the class again until now. I am 19 now and have a stronger mind to learn more computer coding
            </p>

            <p>
                As a kid I was in love with sports. Now its music,sports,coding , and aslo doing youtube. For years ive been chasing my goal to learn how to make an application now i am closer then ever to achieving my goals.auth-image
